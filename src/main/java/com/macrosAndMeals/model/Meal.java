package com.macrosAndMeals.model;

public class Meal {
    //think about wether you should have a private and public bool
    //probably not tbh
    //add a page to sort by top
    //therefore you need to add a likes field
    //nah nah you have forgot the aim of the program mate xd
    //all user made meals should be private bc there is no way of showing it is accurate macros,
    //if they add the meal they should only add it for themselves surely
    //and maybe have a share link for the meal id so users can add a meal someone else has made that is shared through tiktok or something if they trust the macros are right
    //so the user meals table will be the meals that they add that are only used in the generation algortithm for them
    //people can click a button "add to my meals" that will allow them to use that meal n the generation algorithm
    //so make a user created meal page and allow likes and everything
    //so u need a likes field in the meal table, set likes as -1 if its a default meal
    //then user can sort by likes and like date created and stuff to see certain meals
    //so the best meals are at the top and can be added to the users own allowed meals
    //and the user can generate meals and there will be option like to make sure certain meals are included
    //and if the user is not happy with the generation then they can remove a meal and regenerate a set that doesnt include that meal
    //probably allow them to save their meal sets
